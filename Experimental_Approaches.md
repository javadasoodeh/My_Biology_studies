# Introduction to Experimental Approaches in Biological Research

## In Vitro
"In vitro" is a Latin phrase that means "within the glass". It refers to a biological process or experiment that takes place in a controlled environment, such as a test tube or a petri dish, outside of a living organism. In vitro experiments are commonly used in biological and medical research to study cells, tissues, or molecules in isolation from their natural environment.

## In Vivo
"In vivo" is also a Latin phrase that means "within the living". It refers to a biological process or experiment that takes place inside a living organism, such as an animal or a human. In vivo experiments are used to study the effects of drugs, treatments, or interventions in a more realistic and complex environment compared to in vitro experiments.

## In Silico
"In silico" is a Latin phrase that means "performed on computer or via computer simulation". It refers to a process or experiment that is carried out using computational methods, such as computer simulations, mathematical models, or algorithms. In silico experiments are used to predict or simulate biological processes, drug interactions, or disease mechanisms without the need for physical experimentation.

## In Cellulo
"In cellulo" is a Latin phrase that means "within the cell". It refers to a biological process or experiment that takes place inside living cells, typically in a controlled environment such as a cell culture system. In cellulo experiments are used to study cellular processes, such as gene expression, protein interactions, or signaling pathways, in a more complex environment compared to in vitro experiments but without the complexity of a whole organism.

These terms are commonly used in the fields of biology, medicine, and drug development to describe the different levels of complexity and experimental approaches used in research.
